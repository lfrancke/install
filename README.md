# Fast `cargo install` action

NOTE: This is a fork of https://github.com/dtolnay/install to include packages needed by Stackable 

This GitHub Action installs a Rust crate using precompiled signed binaries built
on GitHub and hosted as GitHub release artifacts.

## Example workflow

```yaml
name: test suite
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  expand:
    name: cargo udeps
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: stackabletech/install@master
        with:
          crate: cargo-expand
      - run: cargo expand --help
```

### Development

Unless you're setting up an entirely new branch, work in the main branch.
When you make changes you can later run the `scripts/rebase.sh` script with the name of a branch to update.

For example:
```bash
scripts/rebase.sh cargo-udeps
```
